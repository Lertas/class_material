    "\n",
    "Based on: https://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-machine-learning-python/\n",
    "        \n",
    "Feature selection is a process where you automatically select those features in your data that contribute most\n",
    "to the prediction variable or output in which you are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of many models, especially linear algorithms like linear and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three benefits of performing feature selection before modeling your data are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Reduces Overfitting: Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.\n",
    " * Improves Accuracy: Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.\n",
    " * Reduces Training Time: Less data means that algorithms train faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about feature selection with scikit-learn in the article [Feature selection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Univariate Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical tests can be used to select those features that have the strongest relationship with the output variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn library provides the SelectKBest class that can be used with a suite of different statistical tests to select a specific number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below uses the chi squared ($chi^2$) statistical test for non-negative features to select 4 of the best features from the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset."
